Following the branching strategy as described in https://emagine-reality.atlassian.net/wiki/display/ESBEP/Branch+strategy+B2B+and+HH we currently maintain two branches. This leads to double work for many people (e.g. with two devints, two times configuration, mergebacks, double development, ...), so we want to go back to a single version as soon as possible, if any way possible at the end of this sprint. I individually checked with the POs if they still have objections (and there are actions to check for oms and jbilling). But I want to hear if you see other objections to go back to a single version (please PM me, or e-mail).
